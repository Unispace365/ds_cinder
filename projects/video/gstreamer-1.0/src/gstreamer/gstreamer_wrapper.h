class GStreamerWrapper

Class that provides the functionality to open any kind of media file (movie and sound files) and the possibility to interact with
the file (play, stop, pause, seek, playing speed / direction, loop modes). Furthermore the user has direct access to both the
video and audio buffers that are respectively stored in an unsigned char pointer. Also, various information regarding the media
file can be queried (video size, audio channels, number of video / audio streams and so on)

This Wrapper is based on the GStreamer library, which means all the decoding and synchronization of the media files is done
internally by that library.
