# DS Cinder

DS Cinder is a framework for interactive applications built on top of the fantastic Cinder framework https://libcinder.org/  DS Cinder provides conveniences for getting graphics onscreen; loading data from a sqlite database; displaying PDFs, videos and web pages; providing touch interaction; and loading settings. This thang is designed to make creative touch applications easy to get developed and into production. There's tons of pre-built stuff for creating buttons, keyboards, loading layouts, and more. 



## Getting Started

### Windows

**Install Visual Studio 2019**

1. Download here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/
2. Install it!

**Install Boost**

1. Go to https://boost.org
2. DS Cinder currently uses [version 1.74.0 ](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_74_0.html)
3. You can download the binary package installer from here: [boost 1.74.0 for vs2019](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.74.0/boost_1_74_0-msvc-14.2-64.exe/download)
4. Make a new environment variable
    1. Open the Start menu and type "Advanced System Settings"
    2. Click "Environment Variables"
    3. Under "Sytem variables", select "New..."
    4. Variable name: BOOST_PATH
    5. Variable value: the path of the installed boost (e.g C:\local\boost_1_74_0)
    6. Ok, Ok, Ok

**Install Gstreamer (if you're planning to play videos)**

1. Go to https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/
2. As of this writing, the 1.18.5 version is what you want. Even-number minor versions (the "18" in this case) are the stable releases and the ones to use.
3. Download gstreamer-1.0-devel-msvc-x86_64-1.18.5.msi
4. Download gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86-1.18.5.msi
5. Note: the version numbers will be different if you've selected something else. You want both the "devel" and regular installers, and the x86_64 versions
6. Install both msi installers with the "complete" option
7. If you have any Visual Studio windows open, close them now so they can get the new environment variables set by the gstreamer installers
8. See the [gstreamer read me](https://github.com/Downstream/ds_cinder/blob/develop/projects/video/gstreamer-1.0/README.md) for more info

**Download and compile DS Cinder**

1. Download and install git lfs (large file storage, one binary is too large for regular git) https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Clone this repo with git
3. enter the ds_cinder directory
4. Run: 'git lfs fetch --all'
5. Run: 'git submodule init' & 'git submodule update --recursive' to create & update the Cinder submodule.
6. Make another new environment variable
    1. Open the Start menu and type "Advanced System Settings"
    2. Click "Environment Variables"
    3. Under "Sytem variables", select "New..."
    4. Variable name: DS_PLATFORM_093
    5. Variable value: the path of this downloaded repo (e.g C:\Users\GordonN\Documents\ds_cinder)
    6. Ok, Ok, Ok
7. Open the Cinder project in visual studio (ds_cinder/Cinder/proj/vc2019/Cinder.sln) and compile for Debug-x64 & Release-x64
8. Open an example project in the example folder and compile

## Getting to know ds_cinder

Start with the "getting_started" example - it has a handy guide for basic concepts in ds_cinder. It also has a good number of common ds_cinder components in the app so you can mess with the pieces and see what's what.

## Generating documentation
DsCinder is documented using the doxygen syntax. The documentation can be generated by running the following from the root of the ds_cinder project directory
`doxygen ./doc/doxygen/ds_cinder_Doxyfile`
The documentation is generated in `doc/doxygen/generated/html/` and index.html is the main page.

## Starting a project

There's a project cloner in utility/project_cloner.ps1. Right-click that file and Run with Powershell. That applet will duplicate the full_starter example project with a name and namespace of your choice. From there, you can customize the app as you see fit. The full starter example comes with most of the extention projects (web, pdf, video, etc) already added, so you can start developing right away without messing with property sheets or compilation settings. 

### Linux + Mac

Linux is somewhat supported, but needs some work to be easy to use. Mac support is nearly there.
