/* DS::GL-THREAD
 * Utility for any clients that want to render to a GL texture in
 * a separate thread.  There are two pieces to be aware of:
 *
 * The GlThreadClient is subclassed by anyone that needs a worker
 * thread.  It has a single function for performing operations on
 * that thread.  Note that you can also pass off a delete function
 * to the worker thread for the GlThreadClient subclass, if the
 * class has state that needs to be cleaned up in the worker thread.
 *
 * The GlThread is owned by an object outside of the thread client,
 * and must exist for the life of the thread client.
 *
 * FLOW OF CONTROL
 * ** MAIN THREAD **
 * ThreadClient requests perform
 * - callback is pushed onto thread input queue
 * - input queue is signaled to wake up
 * - return
 * ** WORKER THREAD **
 * Worker is woken up
 * - removes all inputs from the queue
 * - processes each input
 * - goes back to sleep
